## Overview

My ongoing MSc thesis focuses on deepfake detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to enhance detection accuracy through strategic preprocessing, facial region isolation, and robust model architectures.

## Focus Areas

- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Face detection, cropping, frame selection, and augmentation for higher signal-to-noise ratio.
- **Model Architecture**: CNN-based classifiers (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet) with emphasis on generalization and confidence-based evaluation.
- **Evaluation**: Testing models on challenging datasets with Grad-CAM visualizations and confident misclassification analysis.

## Outcome (In Progress)

Currently experimenting with different face-centric pipelines and architectures.
Early results show promising improvements in accuracy and model robustness across datasets like FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF.
