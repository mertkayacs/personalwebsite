## Overview

AgriDL is a full-stack mobile app designed to assist agricultural engineers and greenhouse operators in managing crop health and optimizing yields. It was developed during a government-backed contract with the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and an AI-focused startup. The system leverages real-time sensor data from Arduino devices and integrates ML/DL models trained to maximize tomato growth under various environmental conditions.

## Key Features

- **Sensor Integration**: Real-time monitoring via Arduino-based sensors for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels.
- **Model-Powered Decisions**: Trained ML/DL models offer insights and recommendations for optimal tomato cultivation in vertical farms.
- **Firebase Backend**: Stores and syncs all sensor data, user inputs, and model outputs for scalable access and analysis.
- **Mobile UI**: A clean and responsive Flutter interface allows users to visualize environmental conditions and receive actionable suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Firebase**: For real-time data syncing and authentication.
- **Arduino**: Connected via WiFi modules to collect and transmit sensor data.
- **scikit-learn & Keras**: Used to train and export models predicting optimal growth conditions.
- **Python + Firebase Admin SDK**: For ML model integration and communication with the app backend.

## Challenges and Learnings

Bridging hardware and software was the most complex partâ€”especially syncing data between Firebase and mobile UI while minimizing latency. Another challenge was ensuring ML predictions were interpretable and useful to non-technical greenhouse operators. The project deepened my understanding of IoT integration and edge ML deployment.

## Outcome

The app was successfully deployed in a pilot program, helping monitor and improve greenhouse crop yields. It showcased the power of real-time agricultural tech powered by AI, and opened doors for similar smart farming solutions.
