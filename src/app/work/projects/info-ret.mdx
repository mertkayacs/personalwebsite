## Overview

This project is a fully local information retrieval engine tailored to Turkish-language COVID-19-related content. It simulates a simplified version of a search engine pipeline with core stages including web crawling, indexing, and retrieval. It's built in Python, with integration of a `.jar`-based Turkish NLP library for accurate text handling.

## Key Features

- **Custom Web Crawler**: Fetches thousands of web pages and stores them in structured JSON.
- **Indexing Engine**: Creates an inverted index from parsed data, optimized for fast keyword lookup.
- **Query Interface**: Retrieves relevant pages using basic ranking logic.
- **Turkish NLP Support**: Uses `zemberek-tum-2.0.jar` to properly tokenize and stem Turkish text.
- **No External Dependencies**: Fully offlineâ€”no web frameworks or databases required.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter + PyCharm)
- BeautifulSoup4, Requests, JPype1
- Java-based Zemberek NLP
- JSON for data storage
