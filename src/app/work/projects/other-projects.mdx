## Overview

Beyond my larger-scale AI and software projects, I've built several standalone experiments to deepen my understanding of algorithm design, hardware logic, and optimization techniques.

These projects reflect my interest in the fundamentals of computing and machine learning, and were mostly built from scratch to improve core engineering skills.

## Projects

- **Forestfires-Prediction-with-ML**: A predictive ML model that estimates forest fire risk using weather and vegetation data. Focused on classification accuracy and feature impact.
- **16 Bit Processor Project (Verilog)**: A hardware design for a custom 16-bit processor with an instruction-per-cycle (IPC) of 1. Developed using Verilog to simulate instruction pipelines.
- **ID3-with-Depth-limit (Pure Python)**: Implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm from scratch with a max-depth constraint. Includes simple dataset testing and entropy calculations.
- **Mini-Batch-Gradient-Descent (Pure Python)**: Core implementation of mini-batch gradient descent to train basic models. Built to demonstrate step-wise convergence using NumPy.
