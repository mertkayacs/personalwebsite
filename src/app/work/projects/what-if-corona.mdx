## Overview

**WhatIfCorona** is a machine learning-powered pandemic simulator built as part of my Bachelor's graduation project. The system forecasts COVID-19 spread and impact based on public health metrics like hygiene, mask usage, smoking rates, and age demographics.

At its core is a Flask API that takes real-world parameters and predicts critical outcomes such as total cases, deaths, and recovery ratesâ€”offering a "what if" view into how different country-level interventions might shape the course of a pandemic.

## Key Features

- **API-Driven ML Model**: Trained with global COVID-19 data to make real-time predictions.
- **Rich Feature Set**: Inputs include hygiene practices, age distribution, population size, and more.
- **Population Forecasting**: Trained `.sav` models simulate population shifts to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Fast + Lightweight**: Deployed with Gunicorn and Flask for speed and reliability on Heroku.
- **Mobile-Ready**: Backend powers a React Native mobile app interface for user interaction.
